Data Analytics for Protection of Critical Operating Infrastructures such as SCADA system and the Electric Grid system in Northern America 
 - Used time series data from 2006 to 2010 and cleaned it for meaningful readings. 
 - Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for figuring out important underlying variables at play and classify data. 
 - Assessed dataset by measuring co-variance between variables, Univariate and Multivariate HMM training and testing against different validation sets to see difference in BIC vs Loglikelihood values. 
 - Checked data for anomalies. Performed all these tasks using packages in RStudio such as ggbiplot, depmix ,plyr etc.
